# Project README file

This is **YOUR** Readme file.

**NOTE:** You will submit a PDF version of this readme file named `yourgtaccount-analysis.pdf` containing your writeup (GT account is what you log in with, not your all-digits ID. Example: `jdoe1-analysis.pdf`). This file will be submitted **via Canvas** as a PDF (Project 4 README assignment). You may use any tool you desire to create it, so long as it is a compliant PDF - and for us. Compliant means "we can open it using Acrobat Reader".

**The project readme is limited to 12 pages.** Please keep your readme as short as possible
while still covering all requirements of the assignment. Points will be deducted if the project
readme exceeds the page limit.

## Project Description

Please see [readme.md](./readme.md) for the rubric we use for evaluating your submission.

- A summary description of your project design.  

- Any additional observations that you have about what you've done. Examples:
  - **What created problems for you?**
  - **What tests would you have added to the test suite?**
  - **If you were going to do this project again, how would you improve it?**
  - **If you didn't think something was clear in the documentation, what would you write instead?**
